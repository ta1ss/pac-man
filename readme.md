## How To Run
The game is hosted on the following server:
> http://176.112.158.14:8082/
---
The game features 2 different modes: 

`Campaign` In this mode, you will progress through a series of simpler maps with a level progression and a story. Each level will be increasingly challenging, and you will need to use your wits to outsmart the ghosts and collect all the yellow pellets to progress.

`Regular` Test your skills against other players from around the world. Challenging maps in a random order, scores are recorded and uploaded. Do you have what it takes to top the scores?
